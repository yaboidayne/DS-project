Project Idea: Task Manager with Priority Queue

Description:
Develop a task manager application that allows users to create, prioritize, and manage their tasks. The application should utilize various data structures to efficiently store and process tasks based on their priorities.

Features:
1. Task Creation:
  Allow users to create tasks with details such as task name, description, and priority.
  Utilize a data structure like a dictionary or a class to represent and store task objects.
  
2. Task Priority:
  Implement a priority queue data structure to efficiently manage and process tasks based on their priorities.
  Assign priority levels to tasks (e.g., high, medium, low) and ensure that higher priority tasks are processed first.
  
3. Task Management:
  Provide functionalities to add, update, and delete tasks.
  Allow users to mark tasks as completed or pending.
  Implement data structures like lists or linked lists to store and manage tasks.
  
4. Task Sorting and Filtering:
  Implement sorting and filtering mechanisms to organize tasks based on different criteria (e.g., priority, due date, completion status).
  Utilize data structures like lists or linked lists for sorting and filtering operations.

5. Task Reminders and Notifications:
  Incorporate functionality to set reminders and receive notifications for approaching or overdue tasks.
  Utilize a data structure like a heap or a tree to efficiently manage and process reminders.
  
6. User Interface:
  Develop a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the task manager application.
  Utilize a GUI (Graphical User Interface) library like Tkinter or PyQt for building the user interface.

7. Data Persistence:
  Implement functionality to save and load tasks from external files or a database.
  Utilize file I/O operations or database management systems to store and retrieve task data.

8. Task Statistics and Reporting:
  Provide insights and statistics about tasks, such as the number of completed tasks, pending tasks, tasks by priority, etc.
  Utilize data structures and algorithms to calculate and present task-related statistics.
